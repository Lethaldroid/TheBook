        <br />
        There was once an infinite void—<span class="comments">Chaos</span><br />
        Something similar existed <span class="keyword">inside me</span> too,<br />
        But your <span class="keyword">beauty</span>,<br />
        Started a <span class="keyword">world</span> within me, completely anew.<br /><br />

        Like <span class="comments">Cronus</span> trying to escape his fate,<br />
        I <span class="keyword">wish</span> we could too,<br />
        Become suspended in the <span class="keyword">moments</span>,<br />
        That feel <span class="keyword">eternal</span>.<br /><br />

        Tell me, <span class="comments">Atlas</span>, what is heavier?<br />
        The world upon your shoulders, or the weight of my <span class="keyword">heart</span>?<br /><br />

        <span class="comments">Icarus</span> soared too high, burned by ambition,<br />
        But with you, I find the <span class="keyword">balance</span> that he missed.<br />
        Like <span class="comments">Prometheus</span> gifting fire to mankind,<br />
        You ignite within me a <span class="keyword">flame</span> that endures.<br />
        <span class="comments">Pandora</span> opened her box and set free all torments,<br />
        Yet <span class="keyword">hope</span> remains with me, shaped in the form of you.<br /><br />

        <span class="comments">Apollo</span>’s pursuit of <span class="comments">Daphne</span> fades in comparison,<br />
        For I chase no fleeting <span class="keyword">beauty</span>, but something far deeper.<br />
        And <span class="comments">Narcissus</span>—so lost in his reflection—<br />
        Never knew the <span class="keyword">joy</span> of seeing his lover’s eyes.<br /><br />

        Like <span class="comments">Pygmalion</span> with his perfect sculpture,<br />
        Fates got me a <span class="comments">Psyche</span>—<br />
        With a soul that <span class="keyword">completes</span> me.<br /><br />

        <span class="comments">Eos</span> asked for <span class="comments">Tithonus</span>’s eternal life,<br />
        But I will never make the mistake,<br />
        I would never do that as I,<br />
        Would wish for <span class="keyword">eternal youth</span>,<br />
        And an eternity with <span class="keyword">you</span>.<br /><br />

        <span class="comments">Dionysus</span> gave <span class="comments">Midas</span> a curse; disguised as a gift,<br />
        I think you have that touch too,<br />
        Rather a <span class="keyword">blessing</span> than a curse,<br />
        For your touch, turned my life to <span class="keyword">gold</span>.<br /><br />

        But when the earth darkened,<br />
        With <span class="comments">Persephone</span>’s absence,<br />
        My world would <span class="keyword">wither</span> too— if we grow distant.<br />
        Like <span class="keyword">winter</span>, cold and lifeless, devoid of bloom.<br /><br />

        <span class="comments">Tantalus</span> suffered eternal thirst and hunger,<br />
        And I shall too, for only if I knew,<br />
        When would it be the right moment—the right time,<br />
        To tell you.<br /><br />

        <span class="comments">Sisyphus</span> pushed his boulder,<br />
        But for me, it was never in vain.<br />
        Because you are the <span class="keyword">purpose</span><br />
        That Sisyphus forever seeks.<br /><br />

        In the <span class="comments">Fields of Mourning</span>, where broken hearts once lingered,<br />
        If that’s where you ever went to,<br />
        Like <span class="comments">Orpheus</span> descending for <span class="comments">Eurydice</span>,<br />
        I shall traverse the depths of hell,<br />
        for a single glance back at you.<br /><br />

        <span class="comments">Heracles</span>, completing all of his impossible tasks,<br />
        For I shall complete mine too,<br />
        Even if I have to wait an eternity,<br />
        I will wait for you.<br /><br />

        The <span class="comments">Argonauts</span> sailed for the golden fleece,<br />
        But I think they looked in the wrong place,<br />
        For you are the hidden <span class="keyword">treasure</span>,<br />
        I'll always keep.<br /><br />

        <span class="comments">Talos</span> had a weakness, a single nail in his ankle,<br />
        But you are the thorn in my <span class="keyword">heart</span>, and who can pull that out?<br /><br />

        Interestingly,<br />
        This tale, like the <span class="comments">Greeks</span>, feels like a myth too,<br />
        Like someone in a <span class="keyword">fantasy</span> or <span class="keyword">fiction</span><br />
        That one can only <span class="keyword">dream</span> of,<br />
        I would name this myth,<br />
        <span class="keyword">"The myth of Unprivileged"</span><br /><br />
